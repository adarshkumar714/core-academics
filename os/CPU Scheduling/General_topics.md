### Performance Criteria
- CPU Utilization
    - The main objective of any CPU scheduling algorithm is to keep the CPU as busy as possible.
    - CPU utilization can range from 40 to 90 (0 to 100 in theoretically)
- Throughput
    - A measure of the work done by the CPU is the number of processes being executed and completed per unit of time.
    - The throughput may vary depending on the length or duration of the processes.
- Turn around time
    - Total time taken by the process to execute.
    - Turn Around Time = Completion Time – Arrival Time.
- Waiting time
    - Time spent by the process waiting in the ready queue.
    - Waiting Time = Turnaround Time – Burst Time.
- Response time
    - Response Time = CPU Allocation Time(when the CPU was allocated for the first) – Arrival Time.
- Completion time
    - Time taken by the process to complete its execution.
- Priority
- Predictability
