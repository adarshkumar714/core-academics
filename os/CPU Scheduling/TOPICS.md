# Topics (CPU Scheduling)

- Scheduling Concepts: defination
- [x] Performance Criteria:
    - less waiting time
    - less turn around time
    - less response time
    - high cpu utilization
- [x] Process States: new, ready, running, waiting, blocked
- [x] Process Transition Diagram
- Schedulers
    - short term scheduler
    - mid term scheduler
    - long term scheduler
- Process Control Block (PCB)
- Process address space
- Process identification information
- Threads and their management
- [x] Scheduling Algorithms
    - FCFS (First Come First Served)
