### Features of static method:
***ref***: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-method-in-java-with-examples/
* A static method in Java is a method that is part of a class rather than an instance of that class.
* Every instance of a class has access to the method.
* Static methods have access to class variables (static variables) without using the classâ€™s object (instance).
* Only static data may be accessed by a static method. 

***Run the code***
```shell
javac -d . SM.java
java notes.StaticMethods.SM
```
