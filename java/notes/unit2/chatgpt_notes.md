Sure! Let's break down these topics in Java:

### 1. Exception Handling

#### **The Idea behind Exception**
Exception handling in Java is a mechanism that allows a program to handle runtime errors, so the program can continue execution or fail gracefully. Instead of letting an error crash the application, exceptions provide a way to react to exceptional conditions in programs.

#### **Exceptions & Errors**
- **Exceptions**: These are issues that a program encounters which can be handled programmatically. For example, file not found or division by zero. 
- **Errors**: These are problems that occur at runtime which are usually beyond the control of the application, such as `OutOfMemoryError` or `StackOverflowError`. Errors are generally not meant to be handled by the application code.

#### **Types of Exception**
1. **Checked Exceptions**: These are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. Examples include `IOException` and `SQLException`. You must handle these exceptions using `try-catch` or declare them using `throws`.
2. **Unchecked Exceptions**: These are exceptions that occur at runtime and are not checked at compile-time. They are subclasses of `RuntimeException`. Examples include `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

#### **Control Flow in Exceptions**
When an exception is thrown, the JVM looks for a `catch` block that can handle it. If no such block is found, the exception is propagated up the call stack until it is caught or the program terminates.

#### **JVM Reaction to Exceptions**
When an exception occurs, the JVM tries to find a suitable exception handler in the call stack. If no handler is found, the program terminates, and an error message is displayed.

#### **Use of `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws` in Exception Handling**
- **`try`**: Used to start a block of code that will be monitored for exceptions.
- **`catch`**: Used to handle exceptions that occur in the `try` block. Multiple `catch` blocks can be used to handle different types of exceptions.
- **`finally`**: Used to execute code regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not. It's commonly used to release resources like file handles.
- **`throw`**: Used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or any block of code.
- **`throws`**: Used in a method signature to declare that the method can throw one or more exceptions. It is used to inform the caller of the method about the potential exceptions.

#### **In-built and User Defined Exceptions**
- **In-built Exceptions**: These are provided by the Java standard library, such as `IOException`, `ArithmeticException`, etc.
- **User Defined Exceptions**: These are custom exceptions created by extending the `Exception` class or its subclasses. For example:

```java
public class CustomException extends Exception {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

#### **Checked and Unchecked Exceptions**
- **Checked Exceptions**: Must be either caught or declared in the method signature using `throws`.
- **Unchecked Exceptions**: Do not need to be explicitly handled or declared.

### 2. Input / Output Basics

#### **Byte Streams and Character Streams**
- **Byte Streams**: Handle I/O of raw binary data. They use `InputStream` and `OutputStream` classes. For example, `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`.
- **Character Streams**: Handle I/O of character data and are designed to handle text. They use `Reader` and `Writer` classes. For example, `FileReader` and `FileWriter`.

#### **Reading and Writing Files in Java**
- **Reading Files**: You can use `FileReader` to read text files or `BufferedReader` for efficient reading.
  ```java
  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
  String line;
  while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
      System.out.println(line);
  }
  reader.close();
  ```
- **Writing Files**: You can use `FileWriter` to write text files or `BufferedWriter` for efficient writing.
  ```java
  BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("file.txt"));
  writer.write("Hello, World!");
  writer.close();
  ```

### 3. Multithreading

#### **Thread**
A thread is a lightweight subprocess, the smallest unit of processing. Java supports multithreading, which allows concurrent execution of two or more threads.

#### **Thread Life Cycle**
1. **New**: When a thread is created but not yet started.
2. **Runnable**: When the thread is ready to run and is waiting for CPU time.
3. **Blocked**: When the thread is blocked waiting for a resource or condition.
4. **Waiting**: When the thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.
5. **Timed Waiting**: When the thread is waiting for a specified period.
6. **Terminated**: When the thread has finished executing.

#### **Creating Threads**
- **Extending `Thread` Class**: Create a subclass of `Thread` and override the `run` method.
  ```java
  class MyThread extends Thread {
      public void run() {
          System.out.println("Thread is running");
      }
  }
  ```
  To start the thread: 
  ```java
  MyThread t = new MyThread();
  t.start();
  ```

- **Implementing `Runnable` Interface**: Implement the `Runnable` interface and pass an instance of the class to a `Thread` object.
  ```java
  class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
      public void run() {
          System.out.println("Thread is running");
      }
  }
  Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
  t.start();
  ```

#### **Thread Priorities**
Threads can be assigned priorities between `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` (1) and `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY` (10). Higher priority threads are executed before lower priority threads.

```java
Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
t1.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
```

#### **Synchronizing Threads**
Synchronization is used to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources to prevent data inconsistency.

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
    
    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### **Inter-thread Communication**
Threads can communicate with each other using methods like `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` from the `Object` class. This allows threads to cooperate and share data.

```java
class SharedResource {
    private boolean condition = false;
    
    public synchronized void waitForCondition() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!condition) {
            wait();
        }
        // Do something when condition is true
    }
    
    public synchronized void setCondition(boolean condition) {
        this.condition = condition;
        notify();
    }
}
```
