# Arithmetic operators
a = 3 + 3   # plus
b = 6 - 2   # subtract
c = 8 * 3   # multiplication
d = 5 / 3   # division
e = 9 % 7   # modulo
f = 2 ** 3  # exponent -> 2 power of 3 -> 8
g = 4 // 3  # floor division -> output : 1

# Basic Assignment operators
'''
- = : equal
- += : a+=1 -> a = a + 1
- -= : a-=1 -> a = a - 1
- *= : a*=2 -> a = a * 2
- /= : a/=2 -> a = a / 2
'''

# Comparison operators
'''
- == : compair equality
- != : not equal to
- > : greater than
- < : less than
- >= : greater than equal to
- <= : less than equal to
'''

# Logical operators
'''
* and : returns True if both statements are True
* or : returns True if any one statements is True
* not : reverse the statement
